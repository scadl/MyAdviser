Really simple demo of using sqlite in android app
Wrote this demo at 31th december, to help my friend better understand how to use sqlite in android apps.
Used many articles from several devloper blogs, and several stackoverflow answers too.

Look really close at the comments, becuse they explain everything!<br>
(This project are made with Android studio and gradle build system)
