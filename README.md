Simple demo of using sqlite in android app
Wrote this demo in two seperate days, to help my friend better understand how to use sqlite in android apps.
Based on several articles from some devloper's blogs, and stackoverflow answers.

Look really close at the comments, becuse they explain everything!<br>
(This project are made with Android studio and gradle build system)
